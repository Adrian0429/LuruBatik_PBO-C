Here me and calvin will work on our final project game named "Luru Batik"

Luru batik is a 2 dimensional, Top-Down game built with Java-Swing. 

Made by us, Adrian Karuna Soetikno and Calvin Janitra from PBO-C.

Here player will play and explore the world to find the Indonesian local pride "Batik". Player can explore, interact, and do other stuff on this imaginary world. Player's job is only to find Batik inside of many chest hidden in this world. Unfortunately, it wont be that easy for the player, many monster will cross your path in finding these batik, and dont forget the keys for opening the chest are not easy to find.
